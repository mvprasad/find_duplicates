# HCL Test Find Duplicate Transactions


## Problem Statement

### Find duplicate transactions

Given a list of transactions, find and return duplicate transactions. There can be more than one duplicate transactions.
A transaction can be called duplicate if it has the same `source`, `target`, `amount` and `description`.

This is how a transaction looks like.

{
  id: 1,
  source: 'A',
  target: 'B',
  amount: 300,
  description: 'tikkie'
}

Note:
- Create additional functions if required.
- Follow proper coding conventions and best practices.
- Make sure existing unit test passes.
- Write further unit tests to cover maximum code.
